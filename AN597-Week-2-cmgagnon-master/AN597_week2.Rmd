hi!

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

#Module 4


##Challenge 1
Input data into R.
```{r}
u <- "Stately, plump Buck Mulligan came from the stairhead, bearing a bowl of lather on which a mirror and a razor lay crossed."
u
```
Remove punctuations.
```{r}
v <- gsub("[[:punct:]]","",u)
v
```
Split my string into substrings.
```{r}
w <- strsplit(v," ")[[1]]
w
```
Formating my string into a matrix where each word is a seperate row.
```{r}
z<-matrix(w, nrow = 22 , ncol = 1)
z
```

Obtaining every 3rd character by specifying every 3rd row.
```{r}
z[c(3,6,9,12,15,18,21)]
```



##Challenge 2

This is the matrix we are given:
```{r}
m <- matrix(data=1:80,nrow=8,ncol=10,byrow=FALSE,)
m
```

Create 2 vectors which we can then bind together to end up with columns 2,3, and 6.
```{r}
x1<-m[1:8,2:3]
x1
x2<-m[1:8,6]
x2
x<-cbind(x1,x2)
x
```

This gives us all of rows 6 through 9:
```{r}
x<-m[6:8,1:9]
x
```

This gives us from row 2, column 2 to row 6, column 9:
```{r}
m
x<-m[2:6,2:9]
x
```

##Challenge 3

Creating an array with the number 400 to 1 in decending order and dimensions of 5x5x4x4:
```{r}
a<-array(data=400:1, dim=c(5,5,4,4))
a
```

follow up questions (What do these return):
```{r}
a[1, 1, 1, 2]
```

```{r}
a[2, 3, 2, ]
```

```{r}
a[1:5, 1:5, 3, 3]
```

#Challenge 4
This one is hard, I'm not sure if this is what he is looking for:
```{r}
a<-list("Primates",
        "Haplorhini",
        "Anthropoidea",
        "Platyrrhini",
        c("Cebidae","Atelidae","Pitheciidae"),
        "Catarrhini",
        c("Cercopithecidae","Hylobatidae","Hominidae"),
        "Tarsioidea",
        "Tarsiidae",
        "Strepsirhini",
        "Lorisoidea",
        c("Lorisidae","Galagidae"),
        "Lemuroidea",
        c("Cheirogaleidae","Lepilemuridae","Indriidae","Lem         uridae","Daubentoniidae"))
a
```

Create the 5x3 matrix ordered by row using the provided number
```{r}
b<-matrix(c(3, 0, 1 ,23, 1, 2, 33, 1, 1, 42, 0, 1, 41, 0, 2),nrow=5,ncol=3,byrow=TRUE)
b
```

Coerce into a data frame:
```{r}
df <- data.frame(b)
df
```

Convert column 2 to logical and column 3 to factor
```{r}
as.logical(df$X2)
as.factor(df$X3)
str(df)

```
